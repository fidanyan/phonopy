This folder contains benchmark which will accompany my changes to phonopy-FHI-aims,
which are related to excluding atoms from phonon calculations.
Current state:

constrained-new-phonopy/
    contains test that new version does the job

constrained-supercell-new/
    proves that new version throws error 
    when it's asked to use both constrained atoms and supercell
    (later it may be changed if I implement supercells with constraints)

full-new-phonopy/
full-old-phonopy/
    These two folders show that old and new versions work exactly equally if there are no constrained atoms

full-supercell-new/
full-supercell-old/
    This two folders show, that new version also works equally 
    for supercell, if there are no costrainted atoms.

geop/
    How the geometry of the unit cell was obtained


==================================== HOW TO USE: ====================================
  In each folder run old or new version of 'phonopy-FHI-aims' (see README in folders),
  then run one of 'run-all-dft-*.sh',
  then again in each folder the same version of 'phonopy-FHI-aims'
